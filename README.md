## 1.Used Car Prices Analysis

[**Code**](https://github.com/Wathuomichael/used-car-prices-analysis)

**Goal:** To determine what variables have the biggest effect on used car pricing. 

**Description:** The analysis was on data collected by cardekho from 2003 to 2018. The dataset included mileage, transmission type, fuel type, seller type, number of owners and other information on used cars sold in that period. The project involved splitting the dataset and using the training set to determine which of these factors had the most influence on the selling price using a linear regression model. The model was then used for predictions using the test set.

**Tools:** R, Rstudio, ggplot2

## 2. Heart Disease Classification

[**Code**](https://github.com/Wathuomichael/heart-disease-classification)

**Goal:** To predict whether a patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease.

**Description:** The dataset is from a cardiovascular study in Massachusetts. It contains patients information such as gender, age, education level, blood pressure, cholesterol level, BMI and other variables. The data was used to train and predict by splitting it into a train set and test set using a logistic regression model.

**Tools:** R, Rstudio, ggplot2
